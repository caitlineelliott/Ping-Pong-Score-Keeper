## Ping Pong Score Keeper

I developed a ping pong score keeper application based on a mockup in [Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). 

A live view of the project can be found [here](https://caitlineelliott.github.io/Ping-Pong-Score-Keeper/).
